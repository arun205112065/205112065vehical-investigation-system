This project is totally deals with the security of NITT. If any vehicle is coming in college and it is not of our 
student or faculty, in this case problem is that  nobody can carry id card each time.so I am gonna do is that the
vehicle owner have to register itâ€™s vehicle firstly.whenever student or employee is coming inside college then 
security guard will check registration no weather its of NITT vehicle or other..
registration of vehicles as well as finding stolen vehicles using the registration number.
And it gives the information of the  your vehicle registration if you forget the registration number.
This also facilitates changes the owner of the vehicle,in case of any student wants to sell his vehicle 
and is another student who wants to buy it,then in this case owner of vehicle will be changed.



Their are following options---

1) if you buy new vehicle then for registration their is new registration form is their..and it will generate an 
unique registration no that you have to remember..if forget don't worry,we are having another option for it..

2) If you are coming inside college then security guard will check your registration no..if it is not present or 
you are new then their is a link so that you can register yourself..

3) if you want to sell your vehicle then their is a need to change owner that can be performed here...
